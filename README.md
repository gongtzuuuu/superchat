## Superchat

![website screenshot](/public/preview.jpg)

Superchat's birth was driven by a desire to harness the power of AI and cloud services in the modern era. This project utilises Firebase's robust features: Firebase Authentication allows users to seamlessly log in with their Google accounts, while Firestore Database ensures efficient data storage and near-instantaneous synchronisation. This responsiveness keeps the user experience smooth and effectively caters to users' needs.

Furthermore, Superchat integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, empowering users to choose between conversing with real people or interacting with ChatGPT after logging in. This integration allows users to engage in informative chats, posing questions and receiving insightful responses.
